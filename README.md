# VigilEye

VigilEye aims to develop a system that uses machine learning techniques to detect driver drowsiness or fatigue. The system will monitor the driver's behavior, primarily focusing on their facial expressions and eye movements, to determine signs of drowsiness. When drowsiness is detected, the system will issue an alert to the driver, prompting them to take a break or rest, thus improving road safety.
